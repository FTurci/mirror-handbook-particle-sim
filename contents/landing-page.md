# Handbook of Particle-Based Simulation of Fluids

This Handbook is a gentle, operative introduction to the physics of fluids.

The theory of liquids is presented together with the simulation approaches that allow us to explore their structure and dynamics at the atomistic or molecular level.


All code makes use of the `Python` library `atooms`, an expressive module for particle-based simulation and  analysis.

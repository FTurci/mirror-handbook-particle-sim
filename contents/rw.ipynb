    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic (i.e. *random*) process is a temporal **sequence** of random variables. Possibly the simplest instance of stochastic processes are **random walks**, where the successive elements of the sequence are defined by the following recursive relation\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "x_{n+1} = x_{n}+l \\xi_n,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$ (rw)\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\xi_n$ is a random variable with zero average $\\langle \\xi_n\\rangle=0$ and unit variance $\\langle \\xi_n \\xi_{n\\prime}\\rangle=1$ and $\\ell$ the scale for the random steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index $n$ represents a discretisation of time, so that one can rewrite Eq.{eq}`rw` as \n",

    "In 1827 Robert Brown reported about his optical microscope observations of the irregular motions of pollen grains suspended in water. His serendipituous discovery was originally motivated by a biological motive: to understand the machanisms of reproduction in plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "What he found, instead, was that pollen in water exhibited an erratic motion, regardless of the kind of plant considered, whether the plant was alive or not and regardless of whether the plant was believed to have sexual organs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Link to the original notes by Brown  [&rarr;](https://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/pdfs/dws/Brownian.pdf) .\n",
    "\n",
    "Brown did not attempt an explanation, but did not exclude that the motion was inanimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only much later Albert Einstein provided a physical description that could rationalise Brownian motion. Einstein did this in his seminal 1905 article in *Annalen der Physik* (see a later account in English in {cite}`einstein1956investigations`).\n",

    "## One dimensional motion and its statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "In one dimension, eq.{eq}`rw` represents the motion of a particle on a line, kicked to the left or the right with equal proability and performing steps of length $\\ell$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the process is stochastic, the position of the particle at a given time $t=n\\Delta t$ is also a random variable. Therefore, the key quantity of interest is the probability distribution $P(x_t|x_0)$, i.e. the probability to find the particle at position $x$ at time $t$ knowing that the initial position was $x_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take a general case where the probability to move right is $p$ and the probability to move right is $q=1-p$. \n",

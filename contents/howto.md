# How to use this Handbook

This Handbook presents selected topics from the statistical physics of disordered systems focusing on the properties of soft matter and liquids.

The handbook has the characteristic quality of developing around the **computational** approaches that such physical problems require and inspire.

To do so, it leverages the `Python` environment extensively, using `jupyter notebooks` as the containers of both theoretical and applied lessons.

## Modes of access

### Jupyter book

The Handbook can be used in a read-only mode in  its `jupyter book` format at the address
https://atooms.frama.io/handbook/html/contents/landing-page.html.

The `jupyter book` format also permits to launch interactive sessions using `mybinder` or `thebe`.



### Jupyter lab

The entire Handbook or individual sections of the book can be downloaded locally for further exploration.

The Handbook exploits [`MyST Markdown`](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html) for interactivity (e.g. collapsible content). To enjoy this content, install the corresponding `jupyter` extension:

-  `pip install jupyterlab_myst`

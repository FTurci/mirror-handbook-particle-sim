# Introduction


- Microstates and macrostates
- Time evolution and ergodic hypothesis
- Monte-Carlo vs molecular dynamics
- Equilibrium Ensembles and Nonequilibrium
- Equations of motion: Newton, Langevin, Brown
- Repulsive interactions: a minimal fluid
- Attractive interactions: the liquid
- Measures: static correlations in the liquid
- Measures: dynamic correlations in the liquid
- General properties phase transitions
- Vapor-liquid phase coexistence
- Approachhing the critical point
- Liquid-solid phase coexistence
- Quenching: kinetic arrest
- Annealing: the supercooled liquid
- Fallling out-of-equilibrium: ageing and the glass

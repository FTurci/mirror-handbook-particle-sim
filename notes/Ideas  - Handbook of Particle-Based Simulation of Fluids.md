# Ideas  - Handbook of Particle-Based Simulation of Fluids



- [] Target audience
  - Master/final year students only?
  - PhD students?
- [] Set out teaching goals:
  - Only insight on algorithms or ability to produce useful results? --> REPOSITORIES 
  - Short note on openmp
  - Fluids or Soft Matter?//--->  LIQUIDS
  - Level of coarse-graining?
  - Only Python (with at least Numba)?
  - What should one be able to do at the end?
    - simulate a glass and analyse its correlation functions?
    - Simulate an active system ?
- [] Prerequisites:
  - possibly only minimal Pyhotn knowledge?
  - How much stat mech is needed?
- [] Any Navier-Stokes content?
- [] Workflows?
